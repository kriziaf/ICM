# The Nine Dot Test: the origin of the phrase "out of the box"

In my attempt to design geometric patterns using p5, I wanted to lay the foundation for a simple interaction project so I thought of visualizing a brain teaser that I recently discovered this summer called the 9 dot test. It was a tough nut to crack!

# Here's the premise of the Nine Dot Test:

Nine dots arranged in a set of three rows. Your challenge is to draw four straight lines which go through the middle of all of the dots without taking the pencil off the paper. (In the digital realm, if you are using a cursor, makes sure it draws the line without taking your cursor off the screen!)

# Using p5.js, I ended up using the following method:
--
ellipse();
line();
strokeweight();
--

Answer Hint: The Nine Dot Test is where the phrase "out of the box" originated.
