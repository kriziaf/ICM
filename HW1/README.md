# The Nine Dot Test: the origin of the phrase "out of the box"

In my attempt to design geometric patterns using p5, I wanted to design a simple interaction so I thought of visualizing a brain teaser that I recently discovered this summer called the "9 dot test". I must have used tons of sheets of paper to solve this teaser. It was a tough nut to crack!

# Here's the premise of the Nine Dot Test:

Nine dots arranged in a set of three rows. Your challenge is to draw four straight lines which go through the middle of all of the dots without taking the pencil off the paper. (Or in digital speak, make sure it draws the line without taking your cursor off the screen!)

# Using p5.js, I ended up using the following methods:

- ellipse();
- line();
- strokeweight();

It's still very basic at this point so I am still continuously reading up on how to bring this game to life with more touch interfaces (possibly something where I can use my index finger or mouse interactions to sketch the answer to the test).

Answer Hint: The Nine Dot Test is where the phrase "out of the box" originated.
